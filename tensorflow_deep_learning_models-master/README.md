# Deep learning models in TensorFlow

This repository contains jupyter notebooks implementing several deep learning models using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). Each notebook contains detailed explanations about each model, hopefully making it easy to understand all steps.

The notebooks run in **Python 3.6, Tensorflow 1.8**

Models:
- [Basic Variational Autoencoder](basic_variational_autoencoder.ipynb)
- [Improved Variational Autoencoder](improved_variational_autoencoder.ipynb)
- [Recurrent Neural Network](RNN_MNIST.ipynb)
- [Convolutional Neural Network](CNN_MNIST.ipynb)
